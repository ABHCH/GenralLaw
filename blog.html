            On October 26 1947 Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir by a latter to the governor general of India offered to accede to India. The Maharaja sent the instrument of accession duly signed by him. The governor general of India Mount Batton, accepted the instrument of accession. As the result of this, the state of Jammu and Kashmir become the part of Indian union. the accession was confirmed by the people of state through their constitution assembly. on Nov. 17 1957. thus at the time of the commencement of the constitution, the position of the state of Jammu and Kashmir was different and therefore article 370 inserted in Indian constitution by the presidential order. Under 370 the presidential is empowered to issue order. Thus act as a legislature in issuing order under this article. It has been held by the supreme Court that the president mat by order extend certain provisions of the Constitution to that state with such modification and exception as he think fit. The state of Jammu and Kashmir has its own constitution and its administration is carried on in accordance with the provision of that Constitution. The parliament of India does not make laws without the concurrence of that state. There was must to take consent of that state for make law by the parliament even the provision regarding emergencies under article 352 of the Indian Constitution can be applied to the state of Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of that state. The directive principles of the state was also not applicable to that state.
     <br>       
            <h3>Reason</h3><br>
            
            With all these issue the parliament of India repealed the article 370 and 35A of the Indian Constitution. There are various changes in the state of Jammu and Kashmir through this decision of government.

In state of Jammu and Kashmir there is no separate flag only national flag of India is applied after revocation. There must be single citizenship in that state. This revocation of article 370 and is very essential for the development of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Now every person who wants to buy property can buy in the state of Jammu and Kashmir
